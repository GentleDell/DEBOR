# Reconstruction of Dressed Body from a Single RGB Image
The goal of this project is to reconstruct a dressed body and full texture from single RGB images.
To this end, we construct a pipeline to estimate the body pose and shape, per-vertex displacements
(as clothes) and UV texture map explicitly. The implementation is based on [VIBE](https://github.com/mkocabas/VIBE), [GraphCMR](https://github.com/nkolot/GraphCMR), [RotationContinuity](https://github.com/papagina/RotationContinuity), [
TexturePose](https://github.com/geopavlakos/TexturePose), [MultiGarmentNetwork](https://github.com/bharat-b7/MultiGarmentNetwork). 

This repo has been tested on Ubuntu18.04 with GTX1650/GTX2070.

### Thirdparty

- [smpl_webuser](http://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de): Registration might be required. Please download the package and copy the smpl_webuser folder to .../DEBOR/script/thirdparty. Meanwhile, copy the neutral SMPL model to .../DEBOR/body_model/.

## Usage
### Dataset preparation
Scripts for data preparation are in the *../DEBOR/scripts/dataset* folder. The configurations of data preparation is stored in *dataset_preparation_cfg.yaml*. Currently, only the MGN dataset is supported.

If dataset augmentation is not required:
- set "enable_displacement=True" and "enable_rendering=True" in dataset_preparation_cfg.yaml. 
- run MGN_dataPreperation.py

If dataset augmentation is required:
- run MGN_dataPreperation.py with "enable_displacement=True" and "enable_rendering=False" in dataset_preparation_cfg.yaml.
- run MGN_dataPreAugmentation.py to augment the dataset. Currently, only pose augmentation is supported.
- run MGN_dataPreperation.py with "enable_displacement=False" and "enable_rendering=True" in dataset_preparation_cfg.yaml to render RGB images.

### Training
Training related scripts are provided in *.../DEBOR/scripts/* folder. Training configurations are set in *train_structure_cfg.py*. 

Train the pipeline with:

```
python train_structure.py 
```
If batch_size=2, a GPU with at least 4GB RAM is required; If batch_size=8, it needs >=8GB GPU RAM; If batch_size=32, it needs >=28GB GPU RAM.

### Inference/Evaluation
If there is a pre-trained model available, *inference.py* and *evaluation.py* are provided for inference and evaluation. Paths to checkpoints, samples, etc, need to be set inside the two scripts. 

Inferencing the model:
```
python inference.py
```

Evaluating the model:
```
python evaluation.py
```
A pre-trained model are provided [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ozxd_9LJHwXHsqyumbbnL8OJYC-0rX-E?usp=sharing). To use it, download all files and copy them to *../DEBOR/logs/local/structure_ver1_full_doubleEnc/* folder.
